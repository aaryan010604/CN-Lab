PRACTICAL NUMBER 1
NETWORKING DEVICES 
1. Router
•	Function: Connects different networks together; routes data from one network to another.
•	Key Use: Connects home/office networks to the internet.
•	Smart Feature: Assigns IP addresses, provides firewall and security.
2. Switch
•	Function: Connects multiple devices (computers, printers, etc.) within a LAN.
•	Key Use: Forwards data to the specific device it's meant for using MAC addresses.
•	Smarter than: A hub (because it sends data only to the intended device).
3. Hub (Legacy device, less used now)
•	Function: Connects multiple Ethernet devices.
•	Key Use: Broadcasts incoming data to all ports (not efficient).
•	Less intelligent: Doesn’t filter data or know destination devices
 4. Modem (Modulator-Demodulator)
•	Function: Converts digital data from a computer to analog for transmission (and vice versa).
•	Key Use: Connects your home network to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).
•	Types: DSL, Cable, Fiber modems
5. Access Point (AP)
•	Function: Extends a wired network by adding Wi-Fi capability.
•	Key Use: Used in wireless LANs (WLANs).
•	Often built-in: Many routers include built-in access points.

6. Network Interface Card (NIC)
•	Function: Allows a computer to connect to a network.
•	Key Use: Every device on a network needs one.
•	Types: Wired (Ethernet NIC), Wireless (Wi-Fi NIC)

7. Bridge
•	Function: Connects two LANs using the same protocol.
•	Key Use: Divides network into segments to reduce traffic.
•	Smarter than hub: Filters traffic based on MAC addresses🔹 8. Gateway
•	Function: Acts as a translator between different network protocols.
•	Key Use: Connects different systems (e.g., enterprise network to the internet).
9. Repeater
•	Function: Boosts or regenerates signals in a network.
•	Key Use: Extends the range of a network by amplifying the signal.
•	Common in: Large buildings or areas with weak signals.
10. Firewall (Hardware or Software)
•	Function: Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
•	Key Use: Protects against unauthorized access.
11. Brouter (Bridge + Router)
       A Brouter is a hybrid networking device that combines the functions of both a bridge and a router.
TOPOLOGIES
1. Bus Topology
•	Structure: All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus).
•	Data Flow: Data travels in both directions along the cable.
•	Advantages:
o	Easy and inexpensive to implement.
o	Requires less cable than star topology.
•	Disadvantages:
o	If the main cable fails, the entire network goes down.
o	Difficult to troubleshoot.
o	Limited cable length and number of nodes.

 2. Star Topology
•	Structure: All devices are connected to a central device (hub/switch).
•	Data Flow: Devices communicate through the central device.
•	Advantages:
o	Easy to install and manage.
o	Failure of one node doesn’t affect the rest.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Central device is a single point of failure.
o	Uses more cable than bus topology. 

3. Ring Topology
•	Structure: Each device is connected to two others, forming a circular path.
•	Data Flow: Data travels in one direction (or both in a dual ring).
•	Advantages:
o	Data flows in an orderly manner.
•	Disadvantages:
o	A failure in any cable/device breaks the loop.
o	Troubleshooting is hard.
o	Adding/removing devices disrupts the network.  

4. Mesh Topology
•	Structure: Every device is connected to every other device.
•	Types:
o	Full Mesh: All nodes are interconnected.
o	Partial Mesh: Some nodes are interconnected.
•	Advantages:
o	Very reliable and redundant.
o	Failure of one link doesn’t affect communication.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Expensive and complex.
o	Requires lots of cabling and ports.

 5. Tree Topology (Hierarchical)
•	Structure: A combination of star topologies connected to a central bus or main cable.
•	Advantages:
o	Scalable and structured.
o	Easy to expand.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Failure in the backbone affects the entire network.
o	More cabling.

 6. Hybrid Topology
•	Structure: Combination of two or more different topologies.
•	Example: Star-Bus, Star-Ring.
•	Advantages:
o	Flexible and scalable.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Complex design and maintenance.
o	Costly.

BASIC NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING COMMANDS
1. ping
•	Purpose: Tests connectivity to another device or website.
•	Usage:
•	ping google.com
•	ping 192.168.1.1
•	What it shows: Whether the target is reachable, response time, and packet loss.
________________________________________
2. ipconfig (Windows only)
•	Purpose: Displays IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and more.
•	Usage:
•	ipconfig
•	ipconfig /all
•	ipconfig /release
•	ipconfig /renew
•	ipconfig /flushdns
•	Key Uses:
o	/release and /renew help refresh IP address.
o	/flushdns clears the DNS cache.
3. ifconfig (Linux/macOS; deprecated in Linux but still used)
•	Purpose: Shows and configures network interfaces.
•	Usage:
•	ifconfig
Use ip a instead on modern Linux systems.
4. tracert (Windows) / traceroute (Linux/macOS)
•	Purpose: Shows the path (hops) data takes to reach a destination.
•	Usage:
•	tracert google.com      # Windows
•	traceroute google.com   # Linux/macOS
5. nslookup
•	Purpose: Queries DNS to find the IP address of a domain name.
•	Usage:
•	nslookup google.com

6. route
•	Purpose: Displays and manipulates the routing table.
•	Usage:
•	route print       # Windows
•	route -n          # Linux
